Welcome to the **Simplon Projects and Files Repository**! This repository serves as a centralized space for all the projects, files, and learning resources I am working on during my training as an AI Developer at Simplon.

## üìñ About

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Share and organize all the files related to my Simplon coursework.
- Provide easy access to smaller projects, exercises, and experiments that don‚Äôt require a dedicated repository.
- Showcase my progress and learning journey in AI development.

Whether you're a fellow student, instructor, or simply curious about the path to becoming an AI developer, this repository offers a look into the practical exercises and applications I'm working on.

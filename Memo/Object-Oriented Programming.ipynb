    "### 1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and its fundamental principles?**\n",
    "   OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code to manipulate the data. OOP aims to organize code into reusable components. The fundamental principles of OOP are:\n",
    "   - **Encapsulation**: Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (a class).\n",
    "   - **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only necessary parts of the code to the user.\n",
    "   - **Inheritance**: Creating new classes from existing ones, enabling code reuse and hierarchical classifications.\n",
    "   - **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, facilitating method reuse and flexible code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **What are the advantages of OOP compared to traditional programming?**\n",
    "   OOP offers several benefits:\n",
    "   - **Code Reusability**: Through inheritance, existing code can be reused in new contexts.\n",
    "   - **Modularity**: Code is organized into objects, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n",
    "   - **Scalability**: Adding new features or updating existing ones is simpler due to OOP's structured design.\n",
    "   - **Abstraction** and **Encapsulation** make the code safer and more reliable by protecting data and separating implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **How to define a class and an instance in Python? Provide a simple example.**\n",
    "   A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an instance is a specific object created from that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Car:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "           self.brand = brand\n",
    "           self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "       def start_engine(self):\n",
    "           return f\"The engine of the {self.brand} {self.model} is now running.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")  # Creating an instance of the Car class\n",
    "   print(my_car.start_engine())  # Outputs: The engine of the Toyota Corolla is now running.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **What is the difference between a class attribute and an instance attribute?**\n",
    "   - **Class Attribute**: Shared across all instances of a class. Itâ€™s defined directly in the class.\n",
    "   - **Instance Attribute**: Unique to each instance. Defined within the `__init__` method or other instance-specific methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Car:\n",
    "       wheels = 4  # Class attribute, shared by all instances\n",
    "\n",
    "       def __init__(self, brand):\n",
    "           self.brand = brand  # Instance attribute, unique to each instance\n",
    "\n",
    "   car1 = Car(\"Toyota\")\n",
    "   car2 = Car(\"Honda\")\n",
    "   print(car1.wheels)  # 4\n",
    "   print(car2.wheels)  # 4\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Explain the role of the constructor (`__init__`) and special methods like `__str__`.**\n",
    "   - **Constructor (`__init__`)**: A special method that initializes an object when it is created, setting initial attribute values.\n",
    "   - **`__str__`**: Returns a string representation of the object, making it more readable when printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Car:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "           self.brand = brand\n",
    "           self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "       def __str__(self):\n",
    "           return f\"{self.brand} {self.model}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
    "   print(my_car)  # Outputs: Toyota Corolla\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **What is inheritance, and how can it be used to reuse code?**\n",
    "   Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent), facilitating code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Vehicle:\n",
    "       def __init__(self, brand):\n",
    "           self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Car(Vehicle):  # Car inherits from Vehicle\n",
    "       def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "           super().__init__(brand)  # Calls the constructor of Vehicle\n",
    "           self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
    "   print(my_car.brand)  # Outputs: Toyota\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **How is polymorphism useful, and how can it be implemented in Python?**\n",
    "   Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated as instances of the same class. This is useful for writing generic code that can work with objects of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Animal:\n",
    "       def sound(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "       def sound(self):\n",
    "           return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "       def sound(self):\n",
    "           return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n",
    "   for animal in animals:\n",
    "       print(animal.sound())  # Outputs: Woof! Meow!\n",
    "   ```"

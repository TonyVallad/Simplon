## What is Git?

**Git** is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel, Git has become the most widely used version control system in the world.

Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects of any size while maintaining a complete history of changes, enabling them to work simultaneously, manage conflicts, and revert to previous states when needed.

## Key Concepts

### Repositories

A Git repository (or "repo") is a collection of files and their complete history. Repositories can be stored locally or hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

```bash
# Create a new repository
git init

# Clone an existing repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

### Commits

A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash) and includes metadata such as author, date, and a message describing the changes.

```bash
# Stage changes for commit
git add filename.txt    # Stage a specific file
git add .               # Stage all changes

# Commit staged changes
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"

# Amend the last commit
git commit --amend
```

### Branches

Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas in isolation without affecting the main codebase.

```bash
# List all branches
git branch

# Create a new branch
git branch feature-name

# Switch to a branch
git checkout feature-name

# Create and switch to a new branch in one command
git checkout -b feature-name

# Delete a branch
git branch -d feature-name
```

### Merging and Rebasing

Merging and rebasing are ways to integrate changes from one branch into another.

```bash
# Merge a branch into your current branch
git merge feature-name

# Rebase your current branch onto another branch
git rebase main
```

### Remote Repositories

Remote repositories are versions of your project hosted on the internet or network. They facilitate collaboration among team members.

```bash
# List remote repositories
git remote -v

# Add a remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Fetch changes from a remote repository
git fetch origin

# Pull changes from a remote repository (fetch + merge)
git pull origin main

# Push changes to a remote repository
git push origin main
```

## Basic Git Workflow

1. **Create or Clone a Repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   # or
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

2. **Create a Branch for Your Feature or Bug Fix**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Changes to Files**

4. **Stage Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```

6. **Push Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request** (on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)

8. **Merge Your Changes** (after review)
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git merge feature-name
   git push origin main
   ```

## Git Workflow Models

### Gitflow

Gitflow is a branching model with defined branch types and rules for merging between them.

**Main Branches:**
- `main` (or `master`): Production-ready code
- `develop`: Latest delivered development changes

**Supporting Branches:**
- `feature/*`: New features
- `release/*`: Preparing for a release
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent fixes for production

### GitHub Flow

A simpler workflow that emphasizes continuous deployment.

1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make changes and commit
3. Open a Pull Request
4. Discuss and review
5. Deploy and test
6. Merge to `main`

### Trunk-Based Development

A workflow where developers collaborate on a single branch called `trunk` (usually `main`).

1. Pull the latest changes from `trunk`
2. Make small, frequent changes
3. Run tests locally
4. Push to `trunk` (or create short-lived feature branches)

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages that explain **why** a change was made, not just what was changed.

**Structure:**
```
Short summary (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation if necessary. Keep each line under 72 
characters. Explain the problem that this commit is solving and
how it solves it.

Close #123, #456
```

### Branching Strategy

- Keep branches short-lived
- Name branches descriptively
- Follow your team's branching model consistently
- Regularly pull changes from the main branch

### Pull Requests

- Keep PRs small and focused
- Add detailed descriptions
- Link to relevant issues
- Request reviews from appropriate team members
- Address feedback promptly

### Code Reviews

- Be constructive and respectful
- Focus on code, not the author
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Consider both functionality and code quality
- Approve only when you're satisfied with the changes

## Advanced Git Features

### Interactive Staging

Select specific changes within files to stage.

```bash
git add -i
# or
git add -p
```

### Stashing

Temporarily save changes without committing them.

```bash
# Stash current changes
git stash

# List all stashes
git stash list

# Apply the most recent stash
git stash apply

# Apply a specific stash and remove it from the list
git stash pop stash@{1}

# Create a branch from a stash
git stash branch new-branch
```

### Cherry-Picking

Apply specific commits to your current branch.

```bash
git cherry-pick commit-hash
```

### Rebasing Interactively

Rewrite, squash, or drop commits.

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Interactive rebase of the last 3 commits
```

### Reflog

View a log of all reference updates in your repository.

```bash
git reflog
```

### Submodules

Include other Git repositories within your repository.

```bash
# Add a submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/username/repository.git path/to/submodule

# Initialize submodules after cloning
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Git Hooks

Scripts that run automatically when certain events occur.

Common hooks:
- `pre-commit`: Run before commits are created
- `post-commit`: Run after commits are created
- `pre-push`: Run before pushing changes
- `post-merge`: Run after merging changes

## Troubleshooting

### Undoing Changes

```bash
# Discard changes in working directory
git checkout -- filename.txt

# Unstage changes
git reset HEAD filename.txt

# Undo the last commit (preserving changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo the last commit (discarding changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Revert a specific commit (creates a new commit)
git revert commit-hash
```

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

1. Run `git status` to see conflicted files
2. Open conflicted files and resolve conflicts
3. Stage resolved files with `git add`
4. Complete the merge with `git commit`

### Recovering Lost Commits

```bash
# Show the reflog
git reflog

# Restore to a specific point
git reset --hard HEAD@{2}
```

## Git Configuration

### Global Configuration

```bash
# Set user information
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Set default editor
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

# Set default branch name
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Configure line endings
git config --global core.autocrlf true  # Windows

```

### Repository-Specific Configuration

```bash
# Set user information for a specific repository
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Team Collaboration with Git

### Forking Workflow

Common in open-source projects:

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Make changes
4. Push to your fork
5. Create a pull request to the original repository

### Code Review Process

Effective code reviews with Git:

1. Create a pull request with your changes
2. Add relevant reviewers
3. Address feedback through additional commits
4. Merge once approved

### Git Etiquette

Guidelines for team collaboration:

- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Don't rewrite history that's been pushed to shared branches
- Pull before pushing to avoid unnecessary merge commits
- Write meaningful commit messages and PR descriptions
- Clean up branches after they're merged
